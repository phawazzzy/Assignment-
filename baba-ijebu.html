        <legend>HOW TO PLAY INSTANT BET</legend>

        <P>
            The computer has been programmed to pick any number within the range of 1 and 100.<br>
            Then the computer will ask you to guess the number it has picked, if you get the exact number you win <b>#5 000 000, a brand new suv, and house</b>
            <br>
            If the difference between the number picked by the computer and the number you pick is in the range of 1 and 5 you win <b>#1 000 000 and a toyota camry</b>
            <br>
            If the difference between the number picked by the computer and the number you pick is in the range of 6 and 10 you win <b>#500 000</b>
            <br> 
            if the number you pick isnt at this range you lose and you might want to try again.
        </P>
